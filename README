smugapi is a python module to allow access to SmugMug API's through
a convenient Python object interface.  It supports creating and deleting
albums, uploading and downloading images, and adjusting various attributes
of the above.  It also includes a convenient command-line utility, smugtool,
which implements a number of commands useful for managing photos.

Building and Installing smugapi
-------------------------------
On an RPM based distro, building a smugapi RPM is a simple matter of
running "make rpm", and then installing the resulting RPM.  For other
users, you should be able to put smugapi.py wherever your python
site-packages is located (typically something like
/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages), and then put smugtool in /usr/bin.
If you don't have administrator rights on your machine (and hence can't
write files to those directories), you can just use smugtool and smugapi
in-place.
