TODO list:
1)  More tests in the unittest
2)  Find out what's going on with album.set_position(), and make it work
3)  Find out what the heck an album "HighlightID" is, and implement it properly
4)  Fix failing unit tests
5)  .deb for Ubuntu/Debian
6)  Test on Windows
7)  Implement a "set_{album,image}_attributes", that accepts a dictionary and
    will set multiple name=value pairs for the requested album or image at a
    time.  It's more complex, but it should be faster than setting one at a
    time.
8)  Unit test for Captions, Keywords, etc with spaces in them.
9)  Expand the README to include installation instructions (distutils, rpm).
10) Expand the man page to include some example code.
